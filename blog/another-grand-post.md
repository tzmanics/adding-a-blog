## Introducing Scully: the Angular Static Site Generator

What? Angular didn't have a static site generator(SSG) yet? But, it does now! The awesome team at [HeroDevs](https://herodevs.com/) has just released the alpha version of [Scully](https://github.com/scullyio/scully/tree/master/schematics/scully):

> Scully pre-renders each page in your app to plain HTML & CSS. To do this, Scully uses machine learning techniques to find all of the routes in your project. Scully then visits each route, rendering the view and saving it to an HTML file.

If you, like me, have learned of the great benefits of [Angular in the JAMstack](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/10/30/whats-angular-in-the-jamstack-it-sounds-delicious/) and serving up static assets you may have also been asking for an Angular SSG. Well, Christmas doth come early, friend. Enough with the words, words, words, let's code!
